Azure Web App Deployment:
> Go to Web App service and create with the following details:

1. Basic Section:
    select any subscription and Resource group
    Under Instance Details, provide a Name which should be unique. In my case, I'm using the "webappdeployment007" with the default domain, which is ".azurewebsites.net".
    Publish - select code
    Runtime stack - select  Java 11
    Operating System - Windows or Linux (because java is available on both).
    Under App Service Plan : 
    If you have an existing app service plan you can use that or you need to create one.
    In this app service plan, you need to provide a name for your app service plan, under one app service plan we can publish many websites based on their size.
    Select SKU and Size - this is the main field which is related to performance, size and pricing. We have one free app service plan SKU for a lifetime, which is under Linux operating system  "Free F1". I'm selecting Free F1.

2. Deployment:
    We can use the Continuous Deployment through Github, but for the Free F1 plan we dont have these features. so we need to do it manually.

3. Skip All and Create 

> After creating go-to resources and copy and browse the URL which is created by azure with our website name. In my case "https://webappdeployment007.azurewebsites.net/".

> Goto Deployment Center from the left side menu.
    Under Setting:
    select Source - Github
    Because of this, we need to have a GitHub repo in java, in my case I have created a Springboot App and created a Repo (name- WebAppDeploymentInAzure).
    Sign in to your Github account 
    select repo.
    Click on Save.
    After some time it will reflect on the URL.
