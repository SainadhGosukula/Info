# Keycloak

#### How to remove resource_access from the token in keycloak clients:

1. THe Resource Access, Realme Access and Audience are related to scopes. So select the specific client which we need to remove the resource_access. Go to the _client-> scope_ and see what scopes are attached with the client. 
2. By Default _roles_ scope will be added or in most of the companies they will be having they own scopes.
